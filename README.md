I created this chess bot as a small hobby project at home, out of interest and to familiarise myself with C#. It was inpired by and based on a [challenge](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge) created by Sebastian Lague, who has developed the entire frameork, including the logic to implement the rules of chess, helpers to get the state of the board and a GUI to play or watch the games. I have only written the code in MyBot.cs and the credit for everything else goes to Sebastian Lague.
