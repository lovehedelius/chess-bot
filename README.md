I created this chess bot as a small hobby project at home, out of interest and to familiarise myself with C#. It was inpired by and based on a [challenge](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge) created by Sebastian Lague, who has developed the entire frameork, including the logic to implement the rules of chess, helpers to get the state of the board and a GUI to play or watch the games. I have only written the code in MyBot.cs and the credit for everything else goes to Sebastian Lague. The rules of the challange included limitations like maximum memory usage, no accessing the internet or external files, no multithreding and a limit on program size measured in "tokens" (variables, functions, etc.).
